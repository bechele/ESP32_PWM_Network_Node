## Enclosures - cases for the ESP32_PWM_NODE_PCBs
There exist four different cases for ESP32_PWM_NODE PCBs - depending on which PCB you use and if you want to use the W5500 Ethernet network module:
- An enclosure for the SMD based PCB with W5500 Ethernet module.
- An enclosure for the SMD based PCB, but omitting the W5500 Ethernet module.
- An enclosure for the conventional parts based PCB with W5500 Ethernet module.
- An enclosure for the conventional based PCB, but omitting the W5500 Ethernet module.

All enclosures are available as .stl file for 3d printing and as an .obj file for reworking.
